# Election_Results_Challenge - Peyton Arana

## Election Audit Overview
The purpose of this request was to help the Colorado Election Commission verify the valid results of their elections. We used Python to take the information from the spreadsheets that were given to create a program that was able to dissect the data and verify the election results. Furthermore, we were able to get them insight into the voter turnout in each county and how those numbers affected the election.
