# Election_Results_Challenge - Peyton Arana

## Election Audit Overview
The purpose of this request was to help the Colorado Election Commission verify the valid results of this congressional election. We used Python to take the information from the spreadsheet that was given to create a program that was able to dissect the data and verify the election results. Furthermore, we were able to give them insight into the voter turnout in each county and how those numbers affected the election.    

### Election Audit Results
* There were a total of 369,711 votes in the election.

### Further Election Use
This could be a wonderful tool that we could adapt to your many state elections as well. We could modify this code to help run a Senate or Gubernatorial race and we could also use it to provide more information to your committee. We could use this code to determine how Proposition Votes went in the different counties and if we were given more information about votes such as zip code or candidate party we could modify the code to show in greater detail information on Colorado voting trends. This would allow you to further see information that would allow you to make recommendations for any kind of redistricting or notice any outliers that could be investigated further.
